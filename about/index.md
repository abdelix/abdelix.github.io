I am Abdelfetah Hadij and  a Telecommunication engineering student at the University of  Malaga and 
a hacker trainee in my free time. I like  learning  about computer systems , electronics , mathematics, science ,engineering ,etc .
And of course the thing that I enjoy the most is applying my knowledge in projects such as programs or circuits which will be available here.
