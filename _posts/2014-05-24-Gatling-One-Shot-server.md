title: Gatling : an handy and tiny web server
---

Basicaly  gatling  is  a HTTP and FTP server that will export the current working directory to the world.

It is really lightweight and  high performance web server ,or that is what the author claims. Personally I found it  really 
handy for setting up quickly a webserver for testing purposes . 

It is available in the official Debian reposistory so installation in Debian based systems is as easy as :

`$ sudo apt-get install gatling`

It is really easy to use you just need to run gatlling in the directory that you want to be public and you are done .

`$ gatling `


In fact Gatling has more features like :read-only SMB support, https, .htacces ....
