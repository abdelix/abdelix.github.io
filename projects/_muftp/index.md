## muFTP or µFTP
By Abdelfetah Hadij \(<abdel.14@gmail.com>\)

A micro unix ftp client.

Very lightweight and really basic ftp client. I have only done it for fun so don't expect anything espectacular.

#### Dependencies

This ftp client only depends on standard posix libraries .
#### Download

You could get the sources from github  :

* Clone the repo :
	
	git clone
	
* Download the latest version as zip :



#### Build
First of all if you have downloaded the zip version you must decompress it.
And decompressing or cloning the repository you have to open a terminal and change to the project directory.
In a terminal you must run in the main directory of the project :
	
	$ cd build/
	$ make

#### Run
In the same directory as before (build) you must run the shell as :

	$ ./muftp
